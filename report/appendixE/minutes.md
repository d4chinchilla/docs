attendees: Francis, Hugo, Mark, Matt J, Tom    
place: level 3 Zepler labs    

- We met and discussed possible project options
- We ruled out basic sensors as those would be too simple
- We eventually went for a project to detect sound angle over something to measure distance
- Decided project would have a web ui
- Deciding between il matto & display and an LED ring to display output onboard
- Discussed power requirements, and pre-amps
- It would detect sound using four microphones
- It would have a 3D printed case
- Using microcontroller for data collection
- Discussed raspberry pi or FPGA for processing
- Split up code into 5 blocks
- split up project into blocks
- Made github for code and docs

- Discussed idea from last meeting with everybody
- Confirmed everybody was OK with basic idea
- Specified details for requirements
- Detailed processing methods
- Given everybody access to github and explain usage
- Assigned individual leads for each block

## 11:50 19/02/2019
attendees: All + Tim Forcer
place: level 2 Zepler labs

- Discussed project idea and apecific details
- We were advised on the importance of specifying interfaces
- We were advised that we should make test data so that each block can be tested seperately to each other
- We were told about the format of the project and advised about individual roles
