our basic plan was to use four microphones to make a device that can tell the
direction of sounds around it. It would have a web interface and also LEDs which
show the sources of the sounds so that someone deaf could use it to tell when
someone was near them/talking to them we planned what components were necessary,
what kind and split the work into five different computer programs we also made
a github.
