The product was conceived to help deaf people navigate day to day conversations a little easier. Currently, deaf people must follow conversations through the use of lip reading and following contextual cues. This is made more difficult when many people talk at once, or don’t get their attention first when talking. This solution enables deaf people to follow conversations more easily by visualising the sounds coming towards the listener from around the room, in an easy to understand way. It also provides a web interface to make interacting with the device easy, by providing a way to view the current sounds with high accuracy as well as the history of received sounds. It is easy to set up, and any firmware updates would be downloaded through the web interface.

This product is a table-top device, enclosed in its own case, with a sleek, white design. It has a diffused RGB LED ring on top, to indicate incoming sounds as well as their angles, amplitudes and frequencies. It receives its inputs through four microphones on the top of the device, which are sampled and sent to the on board raspberry pi by an arm microcontroller. Cross correlation, and a fast-fourier transform are carried out on the raspberry pi to extract all the necessary information out of the incoming signals. A web interface would be hosted by the raspberry pi which provides detailed read outs of all the information gathered, and provides a secure file upload for firmware updates. There is also a hardware calibration button in the centre of the device, which when pressed, triggers the collection of a ten second sound sample of the background noise. This is used to determine the level of noise which the device should subsequently ignore.

The system should be run on a 5 V ± 400 mV battery with the capability of driving the whole system with no adverse effects on the operation of the system, particularly the microphones, pre-amps and analog to digital converters (ADC). The output of the microphone and pre-amp stages should be between 0 V and 3.3 V. After going through the ADC stage, it should transmit to the microcontroller in real-time at 50 Hz. This information should then be buffered on the microcontroller, and sent to the back-end on the raspberry pi after the data for that packet of information is collected. This transfer should occur at no less than 120 kb/s. Analysis will then be carried out in the back-end and an angle of the sound should be produced to an accuracy of 9o. An amplitude would also be produced and frequency information. The resolution of the back-end outputs should be 8-bits at a frequency of 100 Hz.
