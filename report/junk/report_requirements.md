# Team Project Report Requirements
This is due in at 16:00 on Friday (08/03/2019).

## Sections
### Challenge Solution Statement
(This section is based on what the aims were)

- Describe the specific challenge(s) that your Solution Concept addresses 
- What is the specification that your team chose at the start of the design process? 
- Be specific, it’s a specification. 

### System Design
(this section is based on what your team designed) 

- Explain the design of your system, at a high level. 
- Include a block diagram showing all of the subsystems and how they are connected. 
- Why did you choose this particular architecture? What other options did you consider, and 
why did you reject them? 

### Design Evaluation
(this section is based on what your team designed) 

- How did your design match up against the criteria of 1) difficulty of the specification 
attempted, 2) quality of the electronic design, 3) ease of use, 4) creativity and innovation of 
the designed product, 5) aesthetics, 6) cost, and 7) reliability? 
- You should evaluate it against each of these criteria, in separate paragraphs, followed by any 
additional criteria that you wish to include. 

### Costing, Marketing and Conformance marking 

- Provide details of each of these aspects. 

### Final Product
(this section is based on what was actually produced) 

- Be critical, and compare your achievements against your specification 
- Include a photo(s) of the final product, and an explanation of how it works 
- Discuss further extensions that could be made. 

## References 
- Appendix A: Design Completion Form 
  - You should scan in your signed Design Completion Form (Appendix D) and include it here. 
- Appendix B: Project Completion Form 
  - You should complete the Project Completion Form (Appendix E) and include it here. 
- Appendix C: Circuit Diagrams 
  - The report should include complete circuit schematics, drawn consistently using hierarchical 
    structures and block diagram linking. 
- Appendix D: Software Listings 
  - Include listings of your software, clearly identified and complete with line numbers.  
- Appendix E: Project Meeting Agendas & Minutes 
  - Include records of the agendas and minutes from all your project meetings. 

## More information
Each section can be up to 600 words long, and hence a maximum word count of 3000
words if all sections are fully populated; figures, diagrams, tables and
appendices are not included in this count. **The team report should contain only
things that don’t make sense to include in one of the individual reports.** If a
module was developed by a particular team member, then it should be discussed in
the corresponding individual report.  However, the team report may discuss its
interface with another team member’s module, for example. 
 
There are no mandated formatting templates or requirements for the reports, but
they should be formatted in a single-column (do not use the double-column
template used in the first year A10/A12 assignments).  However, we would
recommend using something similar to the formatting and layout used in the
‘Technical Report’ example on
[https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/notes/TeX/](https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/notes/TeX/).
For those using LaTeX, document templates.
