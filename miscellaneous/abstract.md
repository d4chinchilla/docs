# Project Chinchilla Abstract

Project Chinchilla is a portable device which can accurately measure the angle
from which sounds come from. It was conceived with the intent of helping deaf
people see sounds and where they come from. In addition to situational
awareness, this device will help deaf people can lip-read follow conversations
with multiple interlocutors.

Project Chinchilla will be a self-contained table-top device about 20cm in
diameter. An LED ring on the top of the device will indicate the directions from
which multiple sounds are coming and their frequency. The device will also act
as a web server hosting a detailed page of current and past sounds with their
angle of incidence displayed to a high degree of accuracy. On the roof of the
device, their will be a calibration button. When pressed, the device will take a
10s second sample of the background noise, which it will subsequently actively
ignore.
