Will:  
Looking for a suitable ADC  
Sampling speed and low noise are priorities  
Most probably running off linear reg at 3.3V  
Pseudo-differential ADC moves (potentially) too slowly for the audio  
Differential would be perfect  
Single ended will be fine (probably) as long as careful with layout  
  
Carol:  
Looking for suitable Linear regulator for Mic, Amplifier, etc.  
Looking for suitable battery bank  
Rechargable USB battery bank is stable enough for the RPi  
Will use linear regs to make stable for audio section

Finalising parts list  
Ensuring there are suitable substitute parts if things dont go to plan  

Battery bank has an output of +5V +-5% USB  
Suspiciously also says 9V and 12V outputs from the same port?!
