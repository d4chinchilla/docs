# Evaluation
We will be evaluated on:
* Difficulty of the problem addressed
* Electronic design
* Ease of use of the device
* Creativity and innovation
* Aesthetics
* Cost
* Reliability/Stability
* Dynamic Range/Accuracy
* Ease and effectiveness of calibration
* Documentation

You will be assessed by a number of deliverables. The weighting of the
deliverables is approximately:

| mark   | component                                      |
|:------:|:-----------------------------------------------|
| 5/100  | Project Proposal Form                          |
| 15/100 | Constructed Prototype & Design Completion Form |
| 5/100  | Project Presentation                           |
| 10/100 | Team Report                                    |
| 65/100 | Individual Report (detailed below)             |

The weighting of marks for the individual Report is approximately:

| mark  | component                           |
|:-----:|:------------------------------------|
| 20/65 | Technical Approach                  |
| 15/65 | Achievement and Results             |
| 10/65 | Reporting Writing and Structure     |
| 10/65 | Team Working, Planning and Progress |
| 10/65 | Evaluation and Reflection           |

At the end of the project, your team will have to agree on the effort
contributed by each team member.
