Components
----------

- Reading data from the microcontroller into memory.
  - [ ] started
  - [ ] working

- Doing cross correlation between the four signals.
  - [ ] started
  - [ ] working

- Finding the peaks in the cross correlations.
  - [ ] started
  - [ ] working

- Calculating and checking the angle of the source of the sound from the peaks.
  - [ ] started
  - [ ] working

- Optionally finding the frequency of the peaks so we can colour the LEDs according to frequency.
  - [ ] started
  - [ ] working
  
- x_corr code (tom)
  - [ ] finish on 20/2, but further test is needed
  
- DFT code (tom)
  - [ ] finish on 20/2
  
- find delay elements (tom)
  - [ ] finish on 21/2 (DFT only)
  - [ ] may work on normal case later
