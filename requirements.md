# Requirements
The emphasis should be on achieving the highest possible dynamic range, accuracy
and stability and should comprise all of the following elements.

## Sensing
Your device needs to include at least one sensor, e.g. microphone, camera,
temperature, humidity, accelerometer, proximity, light, colour, etc. This could
be the primary measuring element or it could be to provide supplementary input
for stability (e.g. temperature compensation) or to enhance the user interface.

## Signal Processing
Your device should have some hardware or software algorithm which can be
switched in to process the input signal and enhance the measurement in some way.

## Calibration
Your device should have a way to calibrate itself which may involve additional
hardware/software for self or external calibration. The ease and effectiveness
of calibration is an important factor.

## Interactivity
Your system needs an effective way to interface with the user. Good HCI design
practices should be adopted.

## Connectivity
Your device should also be able to be accessed remotely to enable configuration,
firmware updating and data capture. Think about whether there are existing
standards you could adopt for the communication protocols.  Form Factor:
consider the size/volume of your device. If you expect the user to hold or wear
it, make sure it’s not too large (and not too heavy).

## Lifetime/Power Consumption
Consumers expect battery powered devices to last as long as possible.  As an
ethical engineer, you want to make all devices minimise their energy impact.
